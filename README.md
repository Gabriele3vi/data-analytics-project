### Datasets for PM2.5, PM10 and NO2
These datasets are the CSV versions of the tables in the EU reports on Air Quality. <br>
Each table corresponds to a specific year and includes information on the percentage of the population exposed to various levels of pollutants and the average concentration weighted for the population.
